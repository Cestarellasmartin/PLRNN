# Cristian Scripts organization

This workshop contain the main scripts for general analysis of the laboratory and the project of the Piece-Linear Recurrent Neural Network. Each folder contains their README file of the corresponding scripts.

## General Scripts

We have three main points:
- LFP exploration
- Phenosys_Preprocess
- Spike Hole Detection (Detection of bug in Kilosort 2.5)

## PLRNN Model

We aim to study the role of the OFC and PLC from the dynamical system perspective. For this goal first we need to use the proper model with the optimal hyperparameters. The main Scripts will be focused on:
- Tuning hyperparameters. 
- Evaluation of the trained model.
- SCYFI algorithm
- Analysis of dynamical obtjects
